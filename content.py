In the U.S., enslaved people were forced to work in different roles: field slaves worked on plantations, house slaves served in the homes, and skilled slaves performed trades like blacksmithing or carpentry. The Triangle Slave Trade was a transatlantic system where Europe sent goods to Africa, Africa sent enslaved people to the Americas (via the Middle Passage), and the Americas sent raw materials back to Europe. The Middle Passage was a brutal sea journey for captured Africans, marked by overcrowding, disease, abuse, and high death rates. European colonizers justified slavery using racism and religion, claiming Africans were inferior and destined to serve. Slavery was profitable: plantations made money from crops like cotton, tobacco, sugar, and rice using unpaid labor. African kingdoms were sometimes involved in the trade by selling prisoners of war or enemies to European traders.

Enslaved people resisted in many ways: by working slowly, escaping, or engaging in rebellions or sabotage. The North and South were divided: the South relied heavily on slavery, while the North was more industrial and had mostly outlawed slavery. The abolition of slavery caused a major economic shock in the South, where the economy had been built on forced labor.

Today, Black Americans face higher unemployment, lower wages, and fewer job opportunities than white Americans due to lingering racial inequality. Schools in predominantly Black or low-income neighborhoods often receive less funding, resulting in fewer resources and opportunities. There is a significant racial wealth gap: white families tend to have much more wealth than Black families, even today. The legal system has patterns of discrimination: Black people often receive harsher sentences for the same crimes compared to white people. Living conditions in urban areas are unequal — poorer communities (often Black or Latino) face limited access to healthcare, housing, and quality services. The school-to-prison pipeline describes how school policies (like harsh punishments and suspensions) disproportionately push students of color into the criminal justice system. Modern slavery still exists in forms like human trafficking, forced labor, and unpaid or underpaid prison labor, often hidden from public view.",
